./Bugzilla-All.png:

   Contains all of the contents of this project as separate Fireworks
   CS4 pages in the document.  Tools other than Fireworks will just 
   display the first page, which is the bug page mockup.

./Components/:

   Contains sections of the bug page design that I reused regularly 
   when creating the design note pages.

./Design Notes/:
  
   Contains source files for the design notes, which contain discussion 
   of the interactive aspects of the design.

./Slices/:
 
   Contains rendered gradients, textures, and icons that can be used
   in the Bugzilla design.

./Tabs/:

   Each image in this folder contains a separate mockup of a bug 
   page tab.  These are all Fireworks CS4 source files.
